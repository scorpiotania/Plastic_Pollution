I lay down on this swim platform and put the empty bottle into the ocean with my bare arm and hand.  The boat was going about six knots.  I rinsed the bottle with ocean water twice before filling it.  Potential microplastics contributed to the sample by the sampling process: The boat received a fresh coat of bottom paint about 12 days ago.  It is a very dark blue color.  It may be that the water flowing over the hull broke free some particles of paint. ,,,,,,1/5/2017,1/17/2017,0.975,1,Low,14:45,14:49,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Plastic,1,Zero plastics,

The sample was taken when we thought we were in the Humbolt Current that runs up the S American West Coast from Patagonia, and then turns West in the vicinity of the Equator.  We had noticed that the water temperature had dropped over a couple of days from 31.6 to 27.2 degrees C when the sample was taken.  Also our GPS calculated Speed Over Ground had increased a couple of knots, suggesting a favorable current.
