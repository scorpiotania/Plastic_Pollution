The bottle was about four inches down when sampling. The wind direction was from the water so I felt there was minimal danger of fibers from my clothes blowing into the water where I was sampling. Prior to the sampling I was wearing a beige fleece (100% polyester â€“ I shall avoid wearing that in the future) and a dark green jacket (100% cotton). As mentioned above these were put to one side, downwind. While sampling I retained my Black trousers (pants) (100% algodon â€“ Iâ€™d not come across this word, its Spanish for cotton apparently).  The river at this point is generally about 20 feet wide and perhaps five feet deep. It is in a flood plain and the banks and bed are earth/mud/clay. Beneath the top soil is a layer of gravel.

Although the lake appears wild and rugged on the west side, the developments and tourism on the east are likely to be a source of pollution, though I did not see much evidence of this. I chose the sample site because it is at the exit point of the lakeâ€™s waters, where pollution from its various sites would be well represented.

I chose this location for that reason, because theoretically there should be so little plastic it can be regarded as zero. If there is plastic I imagine there is cause for concern. There are no habitations on the lake except a small settlement at itâ€™s upstream end, including a campsite. The water collected at the lake drains from the surrounding mountains, including Skafell Pike, the highest peak in England. The area is popular with tourists wishing to walk in the hills. I saw very minimal evidence of litter. There is a road adjacent to the side of the lake where I took the sample, but it is only for access to the small village and campsite at the end of the lake. Sampling the site: I had to reach down from the rocky bank and could only sample about 6 inches below the surface.  I was wearing a black top 100% cotton with a dark green jacket, 100% cotton.

The river here is shallow and fast moving with a gravel bed, it meanders splitting and re-joining at various points through the city and across the meadows surrounding it. The sampling point was 100yds downstream from an overflow weir from the main channel, I think far enough for any sediment to settle though the river itself has a lively current. I was by a park so there were unlikely to be culverts etc. locally but a mile upstream much of the water passed through the city. I chose the sample site because it was downstream of the city so a reasonable place to include any evidence of plastics from that urban environment. Upstream from Salisbury is rural with scattered villages and a variety of agriculture, beneath rolling chalk downs.  Sampling the site: I had to reach down from the dry-stone bank and could only sample about 6 inches below the surface.  I was wearing a black T shirt 100% cotton, Black trousers 100% cotton.

South bank of River Thames, within a small corner so tending to attract debris. Tide had just reached its highest point and started to go out as I took the sample. The concrete of the slipway showing in the photos was under water when I took the sample. I was reluctant to wade in too far because although wearing wellington boots the waves were sometimes choppy from passing boats and I wanted to keep the process simple without having to change trousers etc. The water was therefore shallow so the tip of the bottle was not very far beneath the surface of the water. Dense housing, offices and streets lined both shores of the river and close by was a line of houseboats moored along the river  bank. I chose this location because on looking into this, from a non-scientific source (ie Wikipedia), it seems this is a reasonable boundary below which the water begins to become saline as demonstrated by the characteristics of the fish generally found in that area. [Wikipedia says: The district of Teddington a few miles south-west of London's centre marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as Battersea insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as roach, dace, carp, perch, and pike. The Thames Estuary becomes brackish between Battersea and Gravesend, and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace, euryhaline marine species such as flounder, European seabass, mullet, and smelt become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent North Sea and includes both euryhaline and stenohaline marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.]   I was wearing a red and black top with black trousers, both 100% cotton.
